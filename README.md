# ASLang

**A Software Language** — a modern, minimal, and expressive programming language designed for learning, experimenting, and building.
This repository contains the official compiler for ASLang, named **`asl`**.

## 💡 About the Language

ASLang (short for *A Software Language*, pronounced _“a slang”_) is a small, statically typed language with a focus on clarity and simplicity. It's ideal for:

- Writing interpretable or compiled code with minimal syntax
- Exploring compiler design principles
- Creating DSLs or educational tools

The language is still under active development and is **not stable** yet — feedback and contributions are welcome!

## 🛠️ About the Compiler: `asl`

The `asl` compiler is written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and follows a traditional 3-phase compilation pipeline:

### 🔧 Compilation Phases

1. **Tokenization**
   Lexical analysis that converts source code into tokens.

2. **Parsing**
   Builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) from tokens using ASLang grammar.

3. **Code Generation**
   Translates the AST into target code (planned: Nim or C backend, possibly WASM in the future).

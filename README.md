# ASLang

**A Software Language** ‚Äî a modern, minimal, and expressive programming language designed for learning, experimenting, and building.
This repository contains the official compiler for ASLang, named **`asl`**.

## üí° About the Language

ASLang (short for *A Software Language*, pronounced _‚Äúa slang‚Äù_) is a small, statically typed language with a focus on clarity and simplicity. It's ideal for:

- Writing interpretable or compiled code with minimal syntax
- Exploring compiler design principles
- Creating DSLs or educational tools

The language is still under active development and is **not stable** yet ‚Äî feedback and contributions are welcome!

## üõ†Ô∏è About the Compiler: `asl`

The `asl` compiler is written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and follows a traditional 4-phase compilation pipeline:

### üîß Compilation Phases

1. **Tokenization**
   Lexical analysis that converts source code into tokens.

2. **Parsing**
   Builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) from tokens using ASLang grammar.

3. **Resolution**
   Builds an type resolved abstract syntax tree (AST) from raw AST.

4. **Code Generation**
   Translates the Resolved AST into target code (planned: Nim or C backend, possibly WASM in the future).
